<!-- TODO:
pseudocode:
- variable (mathfloor mathrandom) for the winning score
- create 4 buttons as images with crystals
- each crystal button has specific amount of points attatched to click that adds to players score
- check for win/loss if players score === random generated winning score or players score > winning score
- only show crytal values in console.log()
- startGame function refires if player wins or loses
- new random score generated on each startGame
- log wins/ losses on page as player repeats startGame
- random winning score between 19-120
- crystal values between 1-12  -->
